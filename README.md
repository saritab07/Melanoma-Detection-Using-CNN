## Problem Statement
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
In this assigment multiple models were created. We can notice that the final model has best training and validation accuracy. The model overfitting issue is resolved.
Class rebalance helped in augmentation which further helped in getting the best training and validation accuracy. This final model was used for the prediction on the test data
and as we see the model predicted accurately.
Below shows the accuracy and the loss details of the final model
